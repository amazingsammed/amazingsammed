#### Distinguish between internal economic of scale and external economic of scale

In summary, internal economies of scale result from a firm's own growth and expansion, while external economies of scale result from factors outside of the firm's control, such as industry-wide growth and development.

#### What is the characteristic of plant layout

Plant layout refers to the physical arrangement of machines, equipment, and other resources within a manufacturing or production facility. The characteristics of plant layout can vary depending on the type of operation and the specific needs of the business, but some common characteristics include:

- **Efficiency**: Plant layout is designed to optimize the flow of materials and products through the facility, with the aim of minimizing production costs and maximizing output.

- **Safety**: Plant layout should ensure that the working environment is safe and healthy for employees, with adequate space and clear markings for the movement of people and equipment.

- **Flexibility**: A good plant layout should allow for changes in production processes and accommodate different product lines, as well as changes in production volumes.

- **Accessibility**: The layout should be designed to allow for easy access to machines, equipment, and resources, with clear pathways and efficient material handling systems.

- **Aesthetics**: A well-designed plant layout can contribute to a positive work environment, with pleasing aesthetics and well-maintained facilities.

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Plant layout should aim to minimize costs associated with production, such as energy consumption and maintenance expenses.

- **Productivity**: A good plant layout can improve productivity by reducing material handling time, minimizing machine downtime, and improving worker efficiency.

In summary, plant layout should be efficient, safe, flexible, accessible, aesthetically pleasing, cost-effective, and productive.


#### differences between manufacturing and service organisation

The primary difference between manufacturing and service organizations is in the type of output they produce. Manufacturing organizations produce physical products, while service organizations produce intangible services. Here are some other key differences:

- **Tangibility of the output**: The output of manufacturing organizations is tangible, meaning it can be seen, touched, and physically moved. The output of service organizations is intangible and often involves interactions between people, such as a haircut or financial advice.

- **Production processes**: Manufacturing organizations typically have standardized, repeatable processes for producing their products, often involving assembly lines or other types of automated machinery. Service organizations, on the other hand, often rely on customized processes that are tailored to meet the specific needs of each customer.

- **Inventory management**: Manufacturing organizations typically have large inventories of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Service organizations typically do not maintain inventories of finished products, but may maintain inventories of supplies or materials needed to perform their services.

- **Customer interaction**: Service organizations often have direct customer interaction and require a high level of customer service skills and interpersonal communication. Manufacturing organizations may have less direct customer interaction and may focus more on technical skills.

- **Time sensitivity**: Many services are time-sensitive, meaning they must be delivered promptly and efficiently to meet the needs of the customer. Manufacturing organizations also have time-sensitive processes, but the timelines may be longer and more predictable.

- **Quality control**: Manufacturing organizations often have rigorous quality control systems in place to ensure that their products meet high standards of quality and consistency. Service organizations also require quality control, but the focus is on ensuring that the customer's needs are met and that the service is delivered to a high standard.

#### what problems do firm go through when developing new products

Developing new products can be a challenging process for firms, and they may face several problems during this process. Here are some of the most common problems that firms may encounter when developing new products:

- **Market uncertainty**: There may be uncertainty about whether there is a market for the new product, and if so, what the size of the market is, and how much customers are willing to pay for the product.

- **Technological uncertainty**: Developing new products may require new technologies or new applications of existing technologies. There may be uncertainty about whether these technologies can be developed or applied successfully, and whether they will meet customer needs and preferences.

- **Resource constraints**: Developing new products can be expensive, and firms may not have the necessary resources to invest in the development process. This can be especially challenging for smaller firms or firms operating in competitive markets.

- **Coordination challenges**: Developing new products typically involves coordination among multiple departments within the firm, including R&D, marketing, production, and logistics. Coordinating these departments can be a significant challenge, particularly if there are differing goals or priorities.

- **Intellectual property protection**: Developing new products often involves creating new intellectual property, such as patents or trademarks. Protecting this intellectual property can be complex and costly, and firms may need to invest in legal expertise to ensure that their intellectual property is adequately protected.

- **Regulatory compliance**: Depending on the nature of the new product, firms may need to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as safety standards or environmental regulations. Complying with these regulations can be time-consuming and expensive, and failure to comply can result in legal and financial penalties.

- **Competitive pressure**: In competitive markets, firms may need to develop new products to keep up with or gain an advantage over their competitors. However, competing on product development can be challenging, as competitors may have greater resources or more established relationships with suppliers and customers.

In summary, developing new products can be challenging for firms, and they may face problems related to market and technological uncertainty, resource constraints, coordination challenges, intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance, and competitive pressure.

#### what would make a company make or buy

The decision whether to make or buy a product or service is a common dilemma that companies face. The decision is based on a variety of factors, including:

- **Cost**: The primary consideration is often the cost of producing the product or service in-house versus the cost of purchasing it from an external supplier. Companies may choose to buy if it is cheaper to purchase the product or service from an external supplier than to produce it in-house.

- **Capacity and expertise**: Companies may lack the expertise or capacity to produce the product or service in-house, or may not be able to meet the demand for the product or service. In these cases, it may be more feasible to purchase from an external supplier who can provide the necessary expertise and capacity.

- **Control**: Companies may choose to make the product or service in-house to have more control over the quality and production process. Conversely, they may choose to buy from an external supplier to reduce the level of control needed and focus on other aspects of the business.

- **Strategic considerations**: Companies may choose to make or buy based on strategic considerations, such as the need to enter a new market, gain access to new technology, or acquire a key supplier or customer.

- **Risk**: Companies may choose to buy from an external supplier to reduce the risk associated with producing the product or service in-house, such as the risk of equipment failure or supply chain disruptions.

- **Integration**: Companies may choose to make or buy based on the degree of integration with other parts of the business. For example, if the product or service is closely tied to the core business, it may be more feasible to produce it in-house to maintain closer integration with the rest of the business.

In summary, the decision whether to make or buy is based on a variety of factors, including cost, capacity and expertise, control, strategic considerations, risk, and integration with other parts of the business. Companies need to carefully consider these factors and weigh the pros and cons of each option before making a decision.
