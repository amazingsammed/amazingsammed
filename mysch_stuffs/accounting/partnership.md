# Partnership
Partnership is defined, by Ghana’s Incorporated Private Partnership Act (1962), Act 152,  as “the association of two or more individuals carrying on business jointly for the purpose of making profits” (section 3 (1)). 


The Act also states that “no partnership consisting of more than 20 persons or of which 
anybody corporate is a member shall be registered under this Act”, (section 4 (2). 
When the two quoted subsections are put together a more acceptable definition emerges: 
“Partnership is the association of two or more, but not more than twenty individuals 
carrying on business jointly for the purpose of making profits”.
There is however an exception to the maximum membership of twenty. There is no 
maximum limit for firms of professionals like accountants and solicitors.
## Characteristics of Partnership
Following from the definition above, the following characteristics must be noted:
i. the association is formed to make profits.
ii. the profits are shared by the partners; and 
iii. membership is between two and twenty.
One of the characteristics is the sharing of net profits. So this characteristic is an 
evidence of the existence of a partnership. However, there are exceptions to this sharing 
of profit.
\
(a) Family ownership or co-ownership of property shall not of itself create a 
partnership whether or not the family or co-owners share any profit made by the 
use of that property.
(b) The remuneration of a servant or agent of a person engaged in business by a share
of profits of the business shall not of itself make the servant or agent a partner. The 
main criterion that proves a partnership is the Registration of an organization in 
accordance with section 59 and the second schedule of the Incorporated Private 
Partnership Act 1962 Act 152 of Ghana.

## The following also cannot be a partnership:
(i) A company registered under the company’s ordinance (cap 193)
(ii) A company, body corporate or an incorporated association formed under any 
other Act of Parliament and not under Act 152.
(iii) A body corporate formed in accordance with the law of any foreign country 
whether or not carrying on business in Ghana.
(iv) A joint venture without a firm name for one or more specific operations.

## The Nature of Partnership
i. Anybody corporate registered under the Act qualifies to be called a firm.
ii. Under the firm name it is distinct from the partners of whom it is composed 
(Section 12).
iv. It can exercise all the powers of a natural person of fully capacity as long as such
powers can be exercised by a body corporate.
iv. Until dissolved, it has perpetual succession; that is, the firm continues to exist as 
a body corporate until it is dissolved (sections 51, 52).
v. Despite (i) and (ii) above, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts and
obligations of the firm (section 16). It must be noted, however, that a partner may
have a limited liability. But in such a situation, there should be at least a partner 
with unlimited liability in the firm.
## Types of Partners
1. Unlimited Partner: This is a partner who is liable for all the debts and obligations 
of the partnership. Unlimited partner normally takes active part in managing the 
business on behalf of the other partners and is sometimes called general partner or 
active or managing partner

2. Limited Partner: This is a partner who is liable only to the extent of the sum he 
has contributed as capital at the time of entering the partnership. A limited partner 
does not take active part in the management of the partnership business and 
therefore refer to as dormant or sleeping partner. Such a partner only contributes 
to the capital of the firm, is bound by the activities of other partners, and shares the 
profits and losses of the business.
3. Normal or Ostensible Partner
A nominal partner is one who does not have any real interest in the business but 
lends his name to the firm, without any capital contributions, and doesn’t share the 
profits of the business. He also does not usually have a voice in the management of 
the business of the firm, but he is liable to outsiders as an actual partner. It may be 
clarified that a nominal partner is not the same as a sleeping partner. A sleeping 
partner contributes capital shares profits and losses, but is not known to the 
outsiders. A nominal partner, on the contrary, is admitted with the purpose of taking 
advantage of his name or reputation. As such, he is known to the outsiders, although 
he does not share the profits of the firm nor does he take part in its management. 
Nonetheless, both are liable to third parties for the acts of the firm.
Relationships between partners
▪ Because of the nature of a partnership, the Act specifies the relationship that should
exist between partners (Section 34). 
▪ The Act states that the relationship is a fiduciary one. Meaning, every partner is 
expected to render to every other partner full information of all things affecting the 
firm and to account to the firm for any benefit derived by him without the consent 
of the other partners, from any transaction concerning the firm or from the use by 
him of the firm’s property, name or business connection.
▪ Briefly put, a partner must be transparent and account for every benefit arising from 
the firm to the other partners. There should not be any secret profit.
▪ Section 16 of the Act enjoins every partner to be jointly and severally liable with 
the firm and other partners for all debts and obligations of the firm while he is a 
partner.

## Advantages of Partnership over Sole Proprietorship
1) Two heads (or more) are better than one, more experience and skills are made available to the firm. The sole proprietor may be skilled in one area, but when more than one person combines their skills and experiences a lot more can be achieved. The diverse expertise can make the management of the firm more effective.

2) More capital is available for the business, because two or more partners pool resources and the finances generated is greater than a sole proprietor. This can lead to a rapid expansion of the business within a short period.
3) The financial and operating responsibilities and risks do not rest on only one individual as in the case of a sole proprietor, but rather spread on all the partners.
4) A partnership business has a greater borrowing capacity as it is easier to obtain 
credit facilities from the bank under a firm name than under a sole proprietorship.
5) There is perpetual succession as the death of a partner does not necessarily lead to 
the end of the firm as the case is under sole proprietorship.
6) Though it is obligatory for the firm to keep proper books of account, there is 
continuity of privacy of the affairs of the firm as the partners are under no obligation 
to show their accounts to anyone, (publish their accounts) perhaps except the tax 
authorities. This is an advantage that a partnership has over a limited liability 
company.
7) There is opportunity for income splitting, an advantage of particular importance 
due to resultant tax savings.
8) It is easy to change the legal structure of a partnership into a limited liability 
company in future if circumstances change.
Disadvantages of Partnership
1) Though the firm is a business entity with perpetual succession the partners still have 
unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the firm. Each partner is 'jointly 
and severally' liable for the partnership's debts; that is, each partner is liable for 
their share of the partnership debts as well as being liable for all the debts, except 
that a partner may be a limited liability one.
2) The independence of the individual is lost as each partner need to consult with the 
other partners and consider their views every time a decision of any materials 
consequence is made. The sole trader does not have to consult anybody as he is 
responsible for the decisions and the resultant risks of the business. In other words, 
decision, making is not speedier as under sole proprietorship.

3) Each partner is an agent of the partnership and is liable for actions by other partners, 
therefore, a partner is liable for the debts of the firm even if these are caused by the 
actions of other partners.
4) There is a risk of disagreements and friction among partners and management 
because of inability of some partners to work at a personal level as a result of lack 
of trust and mutual understanding. This human relations problem is absent in sole 
proprietorships.
5) If partners join or leave, probably, there will be the need to value all the partnership 
assets and this can be costly.
6) There are more statutory requirements to meet than under sole proprietorship; for 
example; filing a partnership agreement during registration and keeping of books 
and accounts.
Though there appears to be some disadvantages in pooling resources and expertise in a
firm, the advantages tend to outweigh the disadvantages.
The Partnership Agreement (Partnership Deed)
This is the basic document, which sets out the conditions under which the partners 
agree to operate the firm. It also contains the expected relationship that should exist 
among the partners. This document is important since it is one of the documents 
required by the Registrar before the firm can be registered.
The Act does not give any restriction on what the agreement should contain. It does, 
however, direct the attention of the partners to the major points that the agreement 
should address. 


### These major points are;
i. The name and business of the firm.
ii. The amount of capital each partner is to contribute, whether such capital is to earn 
interest and if yes, the applicable rate of interest.
iii. The ratio for sharing profits and losses
iv. Whether any partner is to receive a salary and if so, the amount 
v. Whether partners’ drawings are to be limited in amount and whether interest on 
drawings is to be charged and if so at what rate.
vi. Whether the capitals are to be fixed and current accounts used for profits, losses, 
drawings and interests, or the capital accounts are to be fluctuating.
vii. The keeping of books and accounts.
viii. The date for the commencement of the partnership and its possible duration.

ix. The method for the valuation of assets, especially goodwill in the case of an 
incoming or outgoing partner and dissolution of the firm 
x. How disputes shall be settled.

## The Rules to Apply in Absence of Formal Partnership Agreement 
- It is expected that the partners agree preferably in writing how the firm will operate. It may, however, happen that for whatever reasons no such formal agreement exists. 

 - The Act, section 35, stipulates the rules which are applicable in such a case.
 
- The Act, however, makes clear that the following rules apply subject to any express 
or implied agreement. This statement makes the rules appear not mandatory since 
the partners can at any time make their own rules.

### The following rules shall apply: 
i. All partners shall be entitled to share equally in the capital contribution and profitsof the firm and shall contribute equally towards the firm’s losses.
ii. The firm shall indemnify every partner in respect of payments made, and personalliabilities incurred by him, in:

   - the ordinary and proper conduct of the business of the firm, and 
   - anything necessarily done for the preservation for the business or property of the firm.
   
iii. If a partner advances beyond the agreed capital contribution he shall be entitled to interest at a rate of 5% per annum (Note that the Act was passed in 1962).
iv. The payment of interest on capital is not before the ascertainment of the profits of 
the firm.
v. Every partner may take part in the management of the business of the firm.
vi. No partner shall be entitled to remuneration for acting in the firm’s business.
vii. No person may be introduced as a partner without his consent and the consent of 
all the existing partners.
viii. Any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the firm’s business 
may be decided by a majority of the partners, but no change may be made in the 
nature of the firm’s business without the consent of all existing partners.
ix. The firm’s books and accounts shall be kept at the place of business of the firm or 
the principal place of business if there is more than one.

Formation and Registration of Partnership Business in Ghana
### (i) Conditions on Registration
In Ghana it is not lawful for any partnership (firm) to commence and /or carry on
business unless it is registered in accordance with the Act. So we need to know what 
the association should do, as required by the Act, before it becomes a firm that can 
carry on business.
From section 5 (1), registration under this Act shall be effected in the following manner.

▪ There shall be sent or delivered to the Registrar for registration a copy of the 
partnership agreement and a statement, in the prescribed form, signed by all the 
partners, containing the following particulars:
a. the full name of the partnership;
b. the general nature of the business;
c. the address and Post Office box number of:
i. the principal place of business of the partnership; and
ii. all other places in Ghana at which the business is carried on 
 a. and any former names, residential addresses and business occupations of partners;
 b. the date of commencement of the partnership.
 c. charges
▪ If the Registrar is satisfied that all conditions for registration have been met,and then upon the payment of the prescribed fee, the partnership is registere.
▪ Registration is renewable yearly.

## Reasons for Refusing Registration
Registration is not automatic. Some reasons form the basis for the refusal of the 
registrar to allow firms to commence or carry on business in Ghana. The reasons may
include any of the following:
1. if the partnership is not registrable in Ghana;
2. if any of the businesses carried on, or to be carried on by the firm is unlawful;
3. if the firm’s name is misleading or undesirable;
4. if any of the partners is an infant, of unsound mind, has been guilty of fraud or 
dishonesty or an undischarged bankrupt; and
5. if the statement is incomplete, illegal or inaccurate or on paper insufficiently durable 
to be suitable for registration.

## Factors Affecting Profit-Sharing Ratios of Partners
 
i. Equal capital contribution by partners 
ii. Active participation in the management/decision making of the firm by all partners

iii.Equal drawings by the partners or no drawings by the partners

iv. No salaries paid to any partner

v. The experience or ability required to manage the firm being about the same
