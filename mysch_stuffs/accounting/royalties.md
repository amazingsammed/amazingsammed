# Royalties
Some businesses, in their operations rely on other entities and individuals by using some assets or resources of such individuals for a fee. The owner of these assets or resources or legal right may as a business arrangement allow another party to exercise them for compensation. The assets and rights commonly encountered in accounting contexts are;
1. **Copyright**- This means to copy the work of an author or artiste. Eg. music, 
 literature
2. **Patent right** – To use a device or process patented by it’s originator or inventor
3. **Mineral right** – To extract minerals from a land belonging to someone else 
 Eg. Clay, quarry stones, gold, diamond, ore, salt, oil, etc 
A payment for the use of any of the above right or assets is called Royalty. It is usually paid annually based on output.

## PARTIES TO ROYALTY AGREEMENT
There are **two** parties to royalty agreement, these are;
1. **Lessor** or Landlord or Grantor: This is the owner of the assets or resources who 
leases it out. He therefore receives the royalty and considers it as income.
2. **Lessee** or Tenant or Grantee: This is the one to whom the asset is leased and therefore has to make the royalty payments to the lessor. The royalty payment is an expense to the lessee.

**Royalties Payable**: This is the royalties that is to be paid by the lessee or tenant to the lessor or landlord during a specific period of time.

### Minimum Rent /Guaranteed Minimum Payment/ Deed Rent
This is the guaranteed minimum amount the lessee must pay the lessor every year for the right to use the asset. Usually in royalty agreements a minimum rent clause is incorporated to **protect** the landlord. It is stated either in units or value.

### Shortworkings
In some years, the actual amount of royalty to be paid by the lessee may be less than the minimum rent. When this happens, the shortage is termed as short-workings. 

**Short-workings** is therefore the excess of the minimum rent over the actual royalties calculated on utilization basis for any year. 

### Shortworkings Recouped or Recovered
Royalty agreements, which contain the minimum rent clause usually, have another clause called the **recoupment of short-workings** clause. When short-workings arise, the lessee pays more money (minimum payment) to the lessor than the actual royalties for that period. 

Therefore, to protect the **lessee**, the recoupment clause in the royalty agreement permits the lessee to be **reimbursed** or recoup short-workings in subsequent periods when the actual royalty is greater than the minimum rent.

However, there is a time limit within which the concession may be exercised. The short-workings become **irrecoverable** after the elapse of the **recoupment period**. The amount to be recouped must not exceed the amount the lease 
agreement allows to be recouped.
