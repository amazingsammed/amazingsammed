# **Definition of a Joint Venture Business**

A **Joint venture** is an arrangement in which two or more parties agree to pool their 
resources for the purpose of a specific task or transaction without the formalities of a longterm partnership agreement for the purpose of making profit and sharing the profits 
between or among themselves in an agreed proportion. The arrangement may be for a 
limited period or for a limited objective. 
\
\
\.
In a **Joint venture**, each of the members is responsible for profits, losses and costs associated
with it. Usually, the enterprise is confined to a particular business or venture in which the 
parties do not use a firm or social name. The liabilities of the parties are limited to their 
profit sharing ratio or as per agreed terms (they do not incur any responsibility beyond the 
limits of the venture). Concerned parties to joint venture are known as **Co-venturers**.

Suppose ‘A’ and ‘B’ undertake the job to develop an underground car park for KNUST for a 
consideration of GH60,000,000. Since they come together for a work on a specific project
with the aim of sharing profit on it, it is termed as a joint venture and each of them (A and 
B) will be called as a **Co-venturer**. This venture will automatically terminate once the 
project is completed.


## Major Features and Characteristics of Joint Venture
Following are the major features of a joint venture −
*  There is an agreement between two or more persons.
*  Joint venture is made for the specific execution of a business plan/project.
*  It is a temporary partnership without the use of a firm name.
*  Agreement for joint ventures is automatically dissolved as soon as specific project is over.
*  Profit & Share are shared on the same terms and conditions agreed upon. 

However, in the absence of any agreement, profit & share will be divided equally.

## Differences between a Joint Ventures and a Partnership 
The description of a joint venture above, in a way, makes it like a partnership. However, 
there are distinct differences between a joint venture and a partnership. In fact, under 53 
(1) of the incorporated private partnership Act, this certainly shows that differences exist 
between a joint ventures and partnership.
1. **Partnerships** are regulated by the **incorporated Private Partnership Act**, 152 of 1962, 
**while** joint ventures are rather regulated by **simple contract law**. 
> Flowing from this, partners in a partnership have joint and several liabilities but in a joint venture, the joint venture’s liability depends on the mode of contracting the venture. Some 
> liabilities may be joint, (if no contracted) while others may influence in the 
> individual capacity of the co-ventures.


2. Also, **a partnership** is a **continuing profit** – making business, but a joint venture is 
a **terminable profit** – making ventures, where the venture ceases on its completion. 
> Thus, while the accounts of partnership are prepared annually (because it is an 
> ongoing business), in the case of a joint venture, only one set of accounts is prepared 
> for the whole venture. However, where the venture lasts for a number of years, 
> interim annual accounts may be prepared. Finally, as noted by the incorporated 
> private partnership Act, the business of a partnership is carried on under firm’s
> name but that of a joint venture is not carried on under any firm’s name


## Advantages of Joint Venture 
1. A joint venture agreement provides a company with expertise it may not have or may 
not be willing to invest in acquiring itself. For example, if one company has a 
combustible material research lab that the venture requires, the company without the 
laboratory gains the benefit of an already established laboratory. 
2. There is an element of risk in most joint ventures. Both joint-venture parties share in 
the risk, such as a financial investment. Should the venture not become profitable, both 
parties can walk away from the deal losing less than if one company independently 
invests in the venture. 
3. A joint venture also provides a company with a way to exit from a secondary business 
or to enter a new business with less of a financial commitment if it were to do this on 
its own.

## Disadvantages of Joint Venture
1. Forming a successful joint venture effort requires time. 
2. Both parties will often come to the potential venture with different goals. 
3. The culture of each company may be different and the integration of both cultures may be difficult or take a long time. 
4. Another problem could be that one or both parties don’t commit enough resources to 
achieve a successful venture.

## Accounting Systems or Records of Joint Venture

Generally, the type of an accounting system to be employed for a joint depends on the size 
of the joint venture and the physical location of the parties involved. To keep a record of 
the joint venture transactions, there are three types of accounting methods. These are: 
1. When one of the Venturers keeps Accounts;
2. When Separate Books of Accounts are kept for the Joint Venture (for large scale);
3. When Separate Books of Accounts are not kept for the Joint Venture (for smaller).



### When one of the Venturers keeps Accounts
This is where one of the co-venturers is appointed to manage the joint venture. That person 
is awarded an extra commission or remuneration out of the profit for his services.

> * CR Cash/Bank A/c



###  When Separate Books of Accounts are kept for the Joint Venture (Joint Venture with Separate and Common Books)
Where the joint venture is of a large scale, it is considered more prudent to consider it as 
a distinct business from the normal business of the ventures (usually the ventures will be 
engaged in their existing business). Therefore, a complete set of books are designed and 
used to record the joint venture transactions. This means that the complete of books will 
be common to all the ventures. 

The main accounts in this separate common set of books are: 

1. Joint Bank Account to record all cash transaction of the joint venture; 
2. Personal or Capital Accounts of the joint ventures These are personal accounts 
of the joint ventures (one for each joint – venture) to record the transactions of 
the joint ventures with the joint ventures. 
3. Joint Venture Account, which is a nominal account used to determine the profit 
or loss made on the joint venture. 

##### Book – keeping Entries 
These are as follows: 
##### (1) Introduction of cash into the joint venture by co-ventures 
> * DR Joint Bank Account
> * CR Personal or Capital Account of each co-venture (with the amount introduced) 


##### (2) Purchase for the joint venture out of joint funds in the joint bank account

##### (7) Payment of expenses on the joint ventures by a co-venturer.
> * DR Joint Venture Account 
> * CR Personal or Capital Account (with the amount involved) 




##  Joint Venture with no Separate Books: (Memorandum Joint Venture Method) 
If the size of a joint venture is small, a separate set of books is not maintained for the joint 
venture. Rather, the joint venture transactions are considered as additions to the main 
business transactions of the joint ventures. 
\
\
\.
Thus, the joint venture transactions are 
incorporated into the main accounting system of the joint-ventures business. So where 
existing accounts in the accounting system of the main business can be used to record the 
joint venture transactions, they are so used. For instance, the cash or bank account use for 
the usual business of the co-ventures will be used to record the joint venture transactions. 
\
\
\.
However, additional accounts are created for the venture only where they are necessary. 
Generally, the accounts, which are peculiar to the joint venture business, and thus have to 
be used include: 
1. The memorandum joint venture account: This is nominal account which is 
used to determine the profit or loss on the venture. 
2. The personal account of the other co-ventures: This is used to ascertain the 
amount due to or from each of the other joint ventures. 
> Under this method each joint-venture keepers records of the joint venture transactions. 
> Each party records only the transactions which affect him in the joint venture account.
\
\.
##### Book-Keeping Entries
1. Each of the ventures opens a personal account. **Example**, if A and B are in joint venture 
business, A will open an account called: Joint Venture with B Account in this book. 
B will also open an account Joint Ventures with A Account in his books. 

2. Make the following Entries: 
(i) All cash contribution, Purchase, and Expenses incurred by a venturer on behalf of 
the joint venture: 
* DR – Joint Venture Account 
* CR – Cash / Bank Account or Creditors Account 

##### (ii) Sales made on behalf of the joint venture; 
* DR – Cash / Bank Account or Debtors Account 
* CR – Joint Venture Account 

##### (iii) Goods taken by a co-venturer for the use of his regular business; 
* DR – Purchase Account 
* CR – Joint Venture Account 

##### (iv) Goods taken by a co-venturer for personal use: 
* DR – Drawings Account 
* CR – Joint Venture Account 

##### (v) Treatment of Closing Stock (Unsold stock): 
Any stock purchased and unsold at the end of the period should be carried down on 
the personal account (Joint Venture Account) who made the purchases. 

##### (vi) When goods are sent from one co-venturer to another, 
no entry is made by the coventurers. This is because, it is a contra entry and no co-venturer spends money on what has changed since it is just the physical location of the goods 

##### (vii) Treatment of Bad debt: 
Where a venturer receives a Del Credere commission all bad debts incurred by him 
or other venturer are charged to him. Such bad debts will not affect the memorandum 
joint venture account. Where no venturer receives Del Credere commission, the bad 
debt is allowed as an expense and charged to the memorandum joint venture account.

##### (viii) **Memorandum Joint Venturer Account**: 
To ascertain the profit or loss of the joint venture business, each venture prepares the 
memorandum joint venture account. It is not part of the double entry system of the 
joint ventures. 
* DR – All items (expenses) at the debit sides of the ventures’ personal account 
* CR – All items (revenue) at the credit sides of the ventures’ personal account 

The balance on the memorandum joint venture account represents a profit from the venture 
if it is a credit balance. If the balance is a debit balance, then it is a loss. The balance is 
shared among the ventures using their pre-determined ratio. 
##### (ix) Profit on the joint venture 

* DR – Joint Venture Account (Personal account) 
* CR – Profit and Loss Account 

##### (x) Loss on the joint venture 
* DR – Profit and Loss Account 
* CR – Joint Venture Account (Personal account) 

##### (xi) Final settlement 
The balance on the joint venture account will show the same amount, each, however, 
appearing on opposite sides in the respective accounts. The debit balance represents 
amounts owed to the co-venturer, while a credit balance means the co-venturer has 
to pay the other co-venturer(s) that amount. 

##### (xii) Interim settlement 
Where interim settlement is made between co-ventures before the final settlement is 
effected, closing stocks in their records should be carried down before closing the 
books to make the interim settlement. After the interim settlement, continue with the 
recording of the remaining transaction and make the final settlement.
